## Encrypt text!
This repo uses php to encrypt and decrypt text. Encrypted text is 
downloaded into a text file, which stores all relevent information in 
XML.
To decrypt, upload the file in decrypt.php and type in the encryption 
key. The contents of the txt file are obtained and used along with the 
key to decrypt the original text.
